# What is Gitea?
* Gitea is a painless self-hosted Git service. It is similar to GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab. Gitea is a fork of Gogs. See the Gitea Announcement blog post to read about the justification for a fork.  
* The goal of this project is to provide the easiest, fastest, and most painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service. With Go, this can be done platform-independently across all platforms which Go supports, including Linux, macOS, and Windows, on x86, amd64, ARM and PowerPC architectures. You can try it out using the online demo.

## Context
Gitea is sponsored by INBlockchain, Equinix Metal, Two Sigma, SoEBeS, Allspice, Towhee, Hostea, and all of the backers on Open Collective.  
This project has been forked from Gogs since November of 2016, but a lot has changed.



## Quality Attributes

### Cross-platform

Gitea runs anywhere Go can compile for. It can run on multiple operating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux, etc. And also multiple CPU architectures: x86_64, i386, arm64, arm, risc-v, etc. Choose the one you love!

### Easy to install

As simple as run the binary for your platform. This also make other options easy, for example ship it with Docker, or get it packaged.

### Lightweight

Gitea has low minimal requirements and can run on an inexpensive Raspberry Pi. Save your machine energy!

### Open Source

Go get code.gitea.io/gitea! Join us by contributing to make this project even better. Donâ€™t be shy to be a contributor!

### Interoperability

Gitea provides webhooks to notify an external system of any changes in repositories.
Also, it provides OAuth/OAuth2 to login, making it easy to integrate with 3rd-party authenticate systems.

### Security

Gitea comes with CSRF and XSS protection and HTTPS support. This improves the security of the deployed instance.

### Multi-database support

Gitea is designed to support multiple databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite3, MSSQL, and TiDB. Allowing user to choose from their favourites.


## Key Drivers

### Quality Attributes
* Low resource consuming
* More platforms supported
* Safe with 2FA support

### Functional Requirements
* More 3rd-party integrations
* More functions in issue tracker

## Early Design Decision 
Gitea shall consume a little resource. GitLab is a all-in-one solution including CI/CD, gists, etc.,
where Gitea aims to only do the code management, issues, etc., without bulit-in CI/CD (but it still retained the ability
to be integrated with 3rd-party CI/CD platforms, like Jenkins, via webhooks. This is a perfect balance of simplicity and ability).  
Gitea shall support multiple platforms. With Go, this can be done platform-independently across **all platforms** which Go supports,
including Linux, macOS, and Windows, on x86, amd64, ARM and PowerPC architectures.  
Gitea shall be easy to use. Gitea provides GUI via web interface, so that end users can use it easily without entering commands on the command line.  
Gtiea shall provide an easy and fast self-hosted Git service.  
Gitea should be similar to existing Git hosting solutions hence users could migrate from other solutions painlessly.
Gitea should be able to migrate to another instance of server when required, by carefully designing its data structure and dependencies.


## Key Stakeholders

### Programmer
Responsible for software development

#### Concerns
* It should provide easy and overall git service.  
* It should ensure security.

### Company
Funding for software development

#### Concerns
* It should consume a little resouce in order to reduce git server costs.

## Technical Context
* Secutiry  
Gitea comes with CSRF and XSS protection and HTTPS support. This improves the security of the deployed instance.

* Multiple OS support  
Written with Go, Gitea can be platform-independent, without any explicit design, across all platforms which Go supports,
including Linux, macOS, BSD-like OS's, Solaris, GNU Hurd, AIX, Windows, and even Android;
on i386, amd64, MIPS, RISC-V, S390(X), ARM, SPARC and PowerPC architectures.

* Support Git v2 protocol  
Gitea should support and follow git protocol because Gitea is a code version management tool based on git command.  
It also have to utilise and integrate with the `git` tool since it is the most popular way to interact with git repositories.  
Moreover, since `git` uses `openssh` and even more tools, gitea should track any update of these tools, in order to be  
compatible with any deploy environments.
